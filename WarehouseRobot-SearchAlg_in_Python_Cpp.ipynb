    "The program contains a single function plan() that takes three parameters: warehouse, dropzone, and todo. The warehouse parameter is a 2D array that represents the layout of the warehouse. The dropzone parameter is a 2-element list that contains the x and y coordinates of the drop zone. The todo parameter is a list of boxes that need to be delivered to the drop zone.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program starts by defining a list of directions and costs for each direction. The directions list contains the 8 directions in clockwise order, starting at UP. The costs list contains the cost for each direction, with diagonal directions having a higher cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the program loops through the todo list and calculates the cost of delivering each box to the drop zone using the A* algorithm. For each box, the program finds the location of the box in the warehouse using nested loops. It then initializes a 2D array h with a value of 99 for each element. The h array represents the estimated cost from each cell to the target cell (i.e., the box location). The A* algorithm then calculates the actual cost from each cell to the target cell and updates the h array accordingly. The cost is calculated using the costs list, and the heuristic is the Manhattan distance between the cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the h array is calculated, the program calculates the actual cost of delivering the box to the drop zone using the h array. The cost is the double of the value of h at the starting location (dropzone) of the robot.\n",

    "The algorithm uses a heuristic function h which estimates the distance between any point in the warehouse and the destination point (xN and yN). Initially, the heuristic value of all points is set to a large value (99 in this case) except for the destination point which is set to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm then iteratively updates the heuristic values for all points until they converge to their correct values. In each iteration, the algorithm considers each point in the warehouse that has not been updated yet and calculates its heuristic value based on the heuristic values of its neighboring points and the cost to move from the neighboring points to the current point. If the new heuristic value is lower than the current heuristic value for the point, the heuristic value is updated and the algorithm continues to iterate until no more updates are made.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the heuristic values for all points have converged, the algorithm uses them to find the shortest path from the starting point (x0 and y0) to the destination point (xN and yN) by iteratively selecting the neighboring point with the lowest heuristic value until the destination point is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **h** list will ultimately store the shortest distance from the starting position to each point in the warehouse, with the starting position having a distance of 0. The **change** variable is used to keep track of whether any updates to h were made during a particular iteration of the loop. If no updates were made, this means that the shortest distances have been found and the loop can exit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the given code, cost += 2*h[y0][x0] calculates the cost of moving the robot from its current position to the next warehouse location in the path. Here, h is a 2D list of integers that stores the Manhattan distance between each location in the warehouse and the target location (i.e., where the robot needs to deliver the package).\n",

    "The Manhattan distance is the sum of the absolute differences of the x-coordinates and y-coordinates between two points. In this case, the Manhattan distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is calculated as |x1-x2| + |y1-y2|.\n",

    "Thus, multiplying the Manhattan distance of the current location with 2 and adding it to the cost variable is used to ensure that the robot always moves closer to the target location, while avoiding obstacles.\n",

    "**Note** that this implementation assumes that the cost to move between any two neighboring points in the warehouse is the same (represented by the costs list) and that the warehouse is represented as a 2D grid of 0's and 1's, where 0's represent open spaces and 1's represent obstacles."

    "The block of code related to **Dijkstra's algorithm** is the while loop. This loop calculates the shortest path from the starting location to the target location using Dijkstra's algorithm. It initializes a 2D array h to store the cost of reaching each location in the warehouse, with all initial costs set to a high value of 99. It then sets the cost of the target location to 0 and starts iterating over all other locations, updating their costs based on their neighbors' costs and the cost to move between them. This continues until the cost of the starting location is found, which represents the shortest path to the target location."
